## Notes

We were required to mimic the functionality of the main_driver function in the script.js into java. This was due to the project 
requiring Junit which is not designed for javascript and would require extensive downloads in order to meet that functionality. Instead,
we chose to convert a single function to test into java then write our Junit test cases based off of that.
